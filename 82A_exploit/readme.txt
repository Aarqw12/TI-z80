>Setup
1. Install Python v3.5 or later.
If prompted during installation, choose to add it to your PATH environment variable.

2. Make sure libusb is installed. On Windows, install LibUSB-Win32.

3. Install PyUSB.
On Windows, this is done via command prompt with administrator privileges.
On Linux/Mac use sudo pip3 install pyusb

4. On Windows, you may need to install a filter driver for the calculator. If so, you may need to re-install this driver every time you plug the calculator into a different USB port.
To do this, you can run the filter wizard in LibUSB-Win32, or you can install all class filters (not recommended), or you can use a libusb driver, such as the one that comes with TiLP II (although this may also require installing a filter driver).

>Running the TI-82 Advanced Exploit
	0. Send APP.8xv to the calculator AND ARCHIVE IT. Run GarbageCollect (in catalog).
	1. Go to Link -> Receive (I don't know what in French, sorry)
	2. Send the TI-82 Advanced backup file by running: python3 tisndrcv.py send_backup 82A_exploit.82B
	3. Accept warning on calculator
	4. Press 2nd+quit when it says done
	5. Unarchive "APP" variable
	6. Type X -> Y [enter] [enter]
	7. MirageOS will be installed
	
To send assembly programs, you must put them in a group, not send them directly.

>Customizing the TI-82 Advanced Exploit
	0. Modify z.z80 as desired
	1. Build the payload by running build.bat or lbuild.sh, which will create z.8xp.
	2. Embed the payload into the TI-82 Advanced backup file by running python3 build_82a_backup.py, which will create 82A_exploit.82B.
