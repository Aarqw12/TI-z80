Linky v0.01
Brandon Wilson

>What is it?
This is a Flash application for the TI-84 Plus, TI-84 Plus Silver Edition, and TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition that serves as a USB host and peripheral mode library for other programs and applications.

The intention is to one day replace usb8x with it.

>How do I get it on my calculator?
Just transfer the application to your calculator (Linky.8xk for the 84+/84+SE, Linky.8ck for the 84+CSE).

>How do I use it?
It's a library, so it's likely that other programs and applications use it. Having it on your calculator is enough for other programs and applications to see and use it.

If you want to use some of its tools or demos, run the application from the APPS menu (LINKYDRV), and then select 1) Tools or 2) Demos and have at it.
