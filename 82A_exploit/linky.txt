To dump the ROM: 
1. In LINKYDRV's Tools menu, select 1) DFU ROM Dump, then choose whether to include the certificate or not. The option is there in case "with" doesn't work (because of a patched unlock exploit or something). 
2. If on Windows, download and run the "zadig" utility to install a WinUSB driver for the new device that's shown up. 
3. Run the dfu-util command line utility with: dfu-util -U dump.rom 

To flash a ROM: 
1. In LINKYDRV's Tools menu, select 2) DFU ROM Write, and then choose to either write the certificate or ignore it. 
2. Run dfu-util from the command line with: dfu-util -D dump.rom 

NOTE: DO NOT choose to write the certificate when flashing the ROM unless you *know* the file you're flashing includes a valid certificate.
