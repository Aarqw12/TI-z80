To install app:

Send the appvar called APP and prgmAPP to the calculator. KEEP THE APPVAR IN RAM.
Asm(prgmAPP will install the application in APP (the one in this zip is MirageOS).

If it doesn't show up in the APPS or MEM menus, reset RAM and then it will.

To make an app var of a (1 page only!) app:

prgmTEST2 will use the number in Ans as a page number for an application and will store the entire application in an ~16KB appvar called APP. Use Calcsys to get the page number of the application you want to store.
