PatchVal v0.1
Brandon Wilson

>What is it?
This patches the OS to allow installing invalid Flash applications (ones with an invalid signature).

Just run it with Asm(prgmPATCHVAL and the OS will be patched.

This works on all OSes/models (including the Nspire's 84+SE emulator)!
But remember, if you install it on the Nspire's 84+SE emulator, it will be lost when re-inserting the keypad, so you'll have to rerun it.

>Why did you call it PATCHVAL?
I honestly don't remember.
